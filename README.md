## Known issues

What is listed below are things I'm aware of, but will have to consider at a later point.

‚ö†Ô∏è Too many API requests (429 error)<br>
üìå Solution: Add debouncing or cache data to avoid excessive API calls.

‚ö†Ô∏è Favorites don't persist on different browsers/devices<br>
üìå Solution: The API doesn't support favorites so I have used localStorage. I'm not sure if I can do anything about this, but I may look into it at a later point.

‚ö†Ô∏è Messy code<br>
üìå Solution: Break the code into smaller and modular blocks of code.
